This package contains source and data for version 0.0.1 of the qoalapack R package. The interfaces and data types of this package are subject to rapid change and should not be used in production code without making a complete copy of the source code. We intend to soon adopt tidy verse lifecycle badges and will detail interfaces which will remain constant.

qoalapack is intended to provide the R interface for the (in progress) qoala probabilistic programming language for probabilistic geometric and spatial computing.

At present this provides data types for working with point process and linear process valued covariates and for fitting convolutional splines models. Additional initial implementations of data structures which are critical for the qoala language are also provided.
